        "It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits are relatives of ours: far nearer to us than
        Elves, or even than Dwarves. Of old they spoke the languages of Men, after their own fashion, and liked and
        disliked much the same things as Men did. But what exactly our relationship is can no longer be discovered."

    </p>

    <p>
        "Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more numerous formerly than they are today; for they love
        peace and quiet and good tilled earth: a well-ordered and well-farmed countryside was their favourite haunt."

    Two hobbits are trying to catch a chicken in the yard.
    Easy task, but these two neighbours can not arrange in any question.
    And now they need to catch the chicken, but they don't talk each other.
    So we need to find an algorithm which will work for the both hobbits independently,
    allow to catch a chicken (by any hobbit) and they will not struck to fence, three or each other.
    And one more - Hobbits can not run or wait forever
    (Chicken catch is important of course, but dinner and ale by schedule).
</p>

<p>
    You are given an yard map as a sequence of strings where:<br>
    - "I" is managed hobbit;<br>
    - "S" is companion;<br>
    - "C" is chicken (our target);<br>
    - "X" is obstacle (a tree, a rock etc)<br>
    <br>
    The yard is rounded by fence.
</p>
<p>
    A chicken and hobbits can move in 8 direction to neighbour cells (including diagonals).
    The Chicken is running always, but Hobbits can wait and stay.
    Actions are described by next strings:<br>
    - "N" north, "S" south, "W" west, "E" east;<br>
    - "NW" north-west, "NE" north-east, "SW" south-west, "SE" south-east;<br>
    - "" (empty string) is to wait.
</p>

<p>
    The Chicken is unpredictable and can use various tactics (even random moving), but he can not go out of the yard.
    Hobbits can not run in obstacles or in fences. And they should not struck each other,
    even for the final jump by the chicken.
</p>

<p>
    And tricky part. Your function will be called twice in each step - for the first and the second hobbit.
    Then the chicken do a move. Hobbits can not communicate each other and make a move simultaneously.
    So be careful with moving the both hobbits in one square.
    You should move a hobbit in the chicken square, but only one (two hobbits and the chicken in one cell is a collision).
    And you have no more 100 moves.
